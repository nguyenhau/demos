# Demo some projects 
Adding some video demo on different projects. I post here only testing version of the applications to follow some confidental issues.

##  Perception System for Serving Mobile Robot
 
 Design, set up, and develop perception module for serving mobile robot that delivers food and drinks on restaurant in Korea. In this video, our robot is tracking and following a target determined.

## AI Depth Estimation from Calibrated Cameras on  a vehicle

To verify the performance of our proposed calibration framework, we performed the depth estimation on rectified image pairs captured by two different cameras in terms of focal length and sensor size.
